# Neural-Network
The neural network source code imported by some of the programs. 
This was done by following a mix of tutorials, and self written code (especially the save and read files), the neural network structure
and matrix math was mostly done by following the Coding Train Channel on YouTube. The test file was used by me to... well to test the neural networks.
